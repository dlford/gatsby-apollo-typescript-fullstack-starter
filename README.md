# Gatsby Apollo Typescript Full-Stack Starter

**This project is still in development!**

This start includes a Node/Express/Apollo-Server backend and a
Gatsby/Apollo-Client frontend, upon completion it will provide
support for user sign-up and authentication, and subscriptions
(webhooks).  All templated code will come with tests written
out of the box.
